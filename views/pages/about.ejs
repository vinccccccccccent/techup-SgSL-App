    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) is an essential skill for communicating with the Deaf community in Singapore.
        However, unlike traditional languages, SgSL lacks robust online translation tools for new learners.
    </p>
    <p>
        People who wish to learn SgSL online—whether for personal, educational, or professional reasons—often find it
        challenging to access resources that are quick and intuitive to learn from. Most available resources focus on
        archiving signs rather than making them accessible to beginners, and the majority of them are offline or geared
        towards helping experienced learners refine their skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        This lack of convenient, centralized tools creates artificial barriers for those eager to learn SgSL, reducing
        its adoption rate. As a result, many individuals struggle to communicate effectively with the Deaf community,
        inadvertently limiting their opportunities for connection and mutual understanding, and ultimately impacting the
        well-being of the Deaf community.

    <h2>How the App Works</h2>
    <p>This web application is designed to make learning SgSL easier and more accessible:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Enter a Phrase</strong>: Type any phrase you want to learn in the input field.</li>
        <li><strong>Search for Signs</strong>: The app tokenizes the input into individual words and retrieves the
            corresponding sign language demonstrations in the form of GIFs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Learn Through Visuals</strong>: For each word in your input, the app displays a GIF showcasing how
            the sign is performed.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The app leverages existing sign banks to present visual learning tools in an intuitive and
        beginner-friendly format, helping users take their first steps toward mastering SgSL.
